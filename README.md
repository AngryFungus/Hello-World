# Hello-World
This is my first try in GitHub.Thank you.

And then I learn 'issue','commit','branch';

'issue':May be I can write some problems or somethings interesting about my code.

'commit':This can show how my project grows up.

'branch':it like photo snapshot,you can change the other branch without change master.
